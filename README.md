## Intro <a name="intro"></a>

This project is designed to identify and characterize distinct customer segments based on synthetic data for a hypothetical brand/retailer. To accomplish this objective, we will employ unsupervised learning clustering algorithms like K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

The segmentation and subsequent customer profiling will provide Brand Co. with valuable insights into its customer base. Understanding these segments will enable the company to tailor its marketing strategies and campaigns according to the unique preferences and behaviors of each customer group.

## Segments/Personas <a name="segmentspersonas"></a>

The project has successfully identified six distinct customer segments, evenly divided into three segments for females and three segments for males. As part of this analysis, unique 'Personas' have been created to represent the female segments.

For detailed profiles of each female 'Persona', access the comprehensive presentation available at the following link: [https://view.genial.ly/657050a9d853170013046bf7/interactive-content-ironhackcustomersegmentation].
