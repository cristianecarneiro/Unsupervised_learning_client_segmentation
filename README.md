## Intro 

This project is designed to identify and characterize distinct customer segments based on synthetic data for a hypothetical brand/retailer. To accomplish this objective, we will employ unsupervised learning clustering algorithms like K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

The segmentation and subsequent customer profiling will provide Brand Co. with valuable insights into its customer base. Understanding these segments will enable the company to tailor its marketing strategies and campaigns according to the unique preferences and behaviors of each customer group.


## Segments/Personas  

The project has led to the identification of X customer segments, comprising Y segments for females and Z segments for males. Each segment has been portrayed through a distinctive 'Persona'.

For comprehensive profiles of each 'Persona', please refer to the presentation linked here: [insert link].
